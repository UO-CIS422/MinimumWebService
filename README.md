# MinimumWebService

We will gather here samples of the simplest web services we can create, 
to serve as examples for students who have not done back-end web development
before.  I will start with a Python Flask example.  I invite others to fill
in examples with different languages, frameworks, and databases, 
all providing an equivalent nanoTwitter service. 

Structure should be MinimumWebService/<language>/<framework> .  If possible support 
multiple databases within a single <framework> directory, but if necessary 
create a <language>/<framework>/<database> directory. 

For example, I will begin by creating MinimumWebService/Python3/Flask, initially 
with one database / storage service; I hope to extend it to dynamically support 
MongoDB, SQLite, and Redis (or to persuade someone who knows SQLite and Redis better
than me to add that support).
